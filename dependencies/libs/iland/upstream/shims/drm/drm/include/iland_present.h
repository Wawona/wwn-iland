/*
 * iland Mode A — in-window present hook.
 *
 * By default iland's DRM/KMS shim presents a client's framebuffer by sending the
 * backing IOSurface to the `framebufferd` Mach service (Mode B — bare-metal
 * WindowServer replacement; macOS-only, requires SIP off + root + entitlements).
 *
 * Mode A registers an in-process callback instead: on every page-flip / atomic
 * FB_ID commit the shim invokes the callback directly with the client's
 * IOSurface, and the host compositor (Wawona) imports it into a CAMetalLayer-
 * backed Metal texture for in-window composition.
 *
 * Mode A is App-Store-safe: no Mach IPC to an external daemon, no private SPI,
 * no code injection, no SIP/root. It is the default path on every Apple platform
 * (incl. macOS) once a callback is registered.
